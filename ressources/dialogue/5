Rima :
	So, you come from the other side of the Great Forest ?  
|Hilda :
	Yes. I don't get why your people don't cross this forest.
	There's a lot of other beautiful cities to see.  
|Rima :
	Well, Oxydia is our hometown. We don't really feel the need to
	go elsewhere.  
|Rima :  
	Futhermore, we don't have good relation with our neighbors.   
	That's why it's best for us to not go in the Great Forest.
