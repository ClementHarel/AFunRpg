Selendia :
So... You heard the news ?
About Oxydia ? ...
|Welma :
Unfortunately, yes. My husband was in the expedition. And he wasn't really
happy about it.
|Selendia :
Who would be ? The goal of this expedition was to destroy an entire town just
to satisfy our King.
|Welma :
I know. Oxydia's people didn't even resist. It was a butchering. And all of that
for no reason...
I hate Elendia.
|Selendia :
You should be glad to live in Elendia instead of Oxydia. Otherwise you will
not be here with me.
|Welma :
How can I be glad to live in a city of killer ? Trust me, if our King continue
his path of madness I will soon leave this cursed city.
