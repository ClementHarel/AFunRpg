@ :
	Delian ? What are you doing in Oxydia ? 
	I thought you left permanently for the city of Noctia.
|Delian :
	I was. But it wasn't my greatest idea.
	It was pretty crazy. I couldn't even find a job. 
|@ :
	I hear stories like this a lot. Why are people of Oxydia so hated ?
|Delian :
	I'm not even sure why... It's an old story involving people that aren't
	alive anymore. But people are stubborn and opinions don't change easily.
