Delior :
It's from bad to worse. I don't even have enough money for myself this month.
How am I supposed to have a family in this city ?
|Nolganne :
It's Delchior's fault. Our king doesn't care about us in the slightest.
The only thing that matters to it is our gold and our taxes.
And that's why we don't have anymore left for ourselves.
|Delior :
Someone's gotta do something ! We can't continue like this !
|Nolganne :
Go ahead, try...
You'll be dead before you achieve anything.
