Henro :
	Welcome @. You slept well ?
|@ :
	Sorry Henro, I had some thing to take care of before coming.
	But I'm ready now.
	What do you need me to do ?  
|Henro :
	I appreciate your motivation @ .
	But today, I have a special favor to ask.
|@ :
	What is it ?
|Henro :
	I'm short on lumber these days.
	I need you to go find some lumber in the Great Forest.
|Henro :
	Go there while I keep the fire alive. And don't waste any time.
|@ :
	Can't I get some lumber on the trees right here ?
|Henro :
	No. The lumber of the Great Forest has far better constitution.
	So stop questionning me and go fetch lumber in the Great Forest
	north of town.
