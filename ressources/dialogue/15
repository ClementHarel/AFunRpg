Volbis :
The economical state of Elendia is quite troubling.
There's only one shop left in the city.
|Volbis :
You can find it by going right from here but if I was you
I wouldn't even bother with it. I heard that even basic supplies cost
more than 100 000 Gold.
|Melgor :
Don't worry @. The shopkeeper is a friend of mine. He will accept to trade
with us for a reasonnable price.
|@ :
Good. We will need as much as possible before we fight the King. Our life may
depend on it.
