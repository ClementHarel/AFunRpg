Fate :
	Hey, you there !
	Do you have some time to listen to me ?
|@ : 
	Sure. What's happening ?
|Fate :
	I lost my necklace in The Great Forest !
|Fate :
	It's not that I really want it back but you see, it's a magical necklace.
	And I wouldn't want it to be picked up by evil hands.
|Fate : So if you see a Necklace in The Great Forest, please pick it up !
