@ :
	Finally, we reached Elendia.
|Melgor : 
	Yes. It's time for us to avenge Oxydia's people.
	We have to kill Elendia's king. For the good of everyone.
|@ :
	Wouldn't Elendia people try to prevent us from killing him ?
|Melgor :
	I don't think so. In fact, I'm sure that they would be quite happy if
	he was gone.
|Melgor :
	Delchior. Elendia "king" is nothing more than a thief that only cares about
	the amount of gold he can make.
|Melgor :
	No one will miss him.
|@ :
	That's good to hear. What do we do then ?
|Melgor :
	Delchior castle is just north from here. But it will of course be a dangerous
	battle. Delchior is extremely powerful.
	That's why I would advice you to prepare carefully beforehand.
|Melgor :
	Maybe by talking to some of Elendia's people here and there we will learn
	some things that would help us in the battle that's ahead.
