	This season of harvesting was really a good one. The Great Forest helps

	In fact, I tend to believe that the side of the forest near Oxydia is far
	better for agricultural work than the rest of it.

	Oxydia was always blessed with this luck. And, to be honest, it's one of the
	only things that we have.
