Melgor :
	Wow, that was a close one. I sure owe you.
|@ :
	Who... Who are you ?
|Melgor :
	Name's Melgor. I'm a traveller that comes from a very far away city.
|Melgor :
	I guess I wasn't prepared to the monsters that are in this forest.
	And you, who are you ?
|@ :
	I'm the apprentice of Henro the blacksmith of Oxydia's city.
	I'm here to gather some wood from the Great Forest for him.
|Melgor :
	Oxydia you say ? I never heard of this city.
|Melgor :
	But anyway.
	 @ ?
	 I have a deal for you.
|@ :
	A deal ? What is it ?
|Melgor :
	I already gathered some wood beforehand. I was planning to sell it
	but I changed my mind.
|Melgor :
	Escort me to Oxydia. And I'll give you the wood you need. 
	This will be my way to thank you for saving me.
|@ :
	Well... Sure.
	Just follow me.
